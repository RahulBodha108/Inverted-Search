# Inverted Search

### **Overview**
This project implements an **Inverted Index** using hash algorithms. An inverted index maps content, such as words or numbers, to their locations in a database or a set of documents. This structure allows for fast full-text searches, making it one of the most popular techniques used in document retrieval systems, such as search engines.

### **Features**
- Efficiently maps words or numbers to their locations in files or documents.
- Implements inverted search using hashing for optimal performance.
- Provides a foundational understanding of indexing for document retrieval.

### **How It Works**
1. **Data Indexing**: Content from documents is processed to build an inverted index.
2. **Search Query**: Users can perform fast searches to locate content across multiple files.
3. **Hash Algorithms**: Hashing is used to store and retrieve index entries efficiently.
4. **Data Structures**: Single linked lists are utilized to manage and link indexed entries.

### **Prerequisites**
Before diving into this project, ensure you are familiar with:
- **Hashing**: Understanding the principles and algorithms behind hash-based indexing.
- **Single Linked List**: Managing dynamic data structures for storing linked entries.
- **File Handling**: Proficiency in reading and processing files programmatically.

### **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Inverted-Search.git
   cd Inverted-Search
