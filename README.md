# Inverted-Search
This repository features the implementation of Inverted Search, using hash algorithms to build an inverted index. The project enables fast full-text searches by mapping content to its locations in files or documents. It strengthens knowledge of hashing, single linked lists, and file handling, while exploring indexing techniques.
